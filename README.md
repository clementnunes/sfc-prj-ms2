# sfc-prj-ms2

## Overview

sfc-prj-ms2 is a sub-project of sfc-prj. 
Web application following Microservice Architecture, using Kafka and ZooKeeper.
This microservice is Consumer.

The service has a Github Actions workflow file which has a few steps :

-	**Test**: it setups test environment ; installing services such as Postgres and NodeJS, then it installs application dependencies, build the application and finally run the test suite.
-	**merge-master-into-preprod**: once testing step is valid, it merges master branch into preproduction branch
-	**merge-master-into-prod**: same logic but into production branch
- **build-preproduction**: install services and application dependencies, build the application to build the Docker Hub image and publish it to Docker Hub.
- **build-production**: same logic but the objective is to deploy the application to production

## Features
The microservice works using NodeJS platform. They are written in TypeScript and uses various dependencies:
-	TypeORM: ORM for NodeJS applications, i.e., Javascript and Typescript
-	Fastify: Web framework used to provide server features especially routing
